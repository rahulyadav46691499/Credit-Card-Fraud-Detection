# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains transaction records, and the goal is to accurately identify which transactions are fraudulent.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis of transaction data
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Machine learning model for fraud detection
- Visualization of fraud patterns
- Jupyter Notebook-based workflow

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulyadav46691499/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Open the main Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled.ipynb`) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VSCode, Google Colab).
- Ensure the data files (`fraudTrain.csv`, `fraudTest.csv`) are present in the repository directory.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform EDA and fraud detection.
